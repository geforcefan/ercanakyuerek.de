My name is Ercan Akyürek, and I am a technology enthusiast in my early thirties with a passion for innovation. Growing up in Germany, I was exposed to a unique blend of German and Turkish cultural influences that have shaped my worldview.</p><p>My fascination with computers started at a young age when I received my first VTech learning computer. Although I didn&rsquo;t initially understand how to write code, the possibilities it presented captivated me. Over time, I taught myself how to program in PHP and eventually moved on to learning C++. By the age of 16, I had already entered the professional field, working for a company that developed a digital asset management system and later for financial institutions. Despite my knowledge and skills improving over the years, my passion for technology has remained constant.</p><p>My area of expertise is web development, particularly within the React ecosystem. I have a high level of proficiency in TypeScript and am adept at using C++ and WebAssembly to enhance the performance of my real-time web applications, such as simulations.</p><p>In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my hobby of building roller coasters on my computer using NoLimits Roller Coaster. I experiment with splines, roll interpolations, roller coaster track generation, and have coded many libraries for a couple of games. Additionally, I have taken up playing darts as a substitution for soccer due to knee injuries. Playing the guitar is another passion of mine that I picked up after sustaining a knee injury from a soccer match when I was 18. As a hardcore metal fan, playing the guitar serves as an excellent stress reliever for me.</p><p>I am happily married and have a 15-month-old child whom I am already introducing to the world of computers. My family is incredibly important to me, and they have always been supportive of my interests and pursuits. Currently, I am working on an open-source roller coaster simulator that I hope will be a valuable resource for the community.## Skills</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.c90b8161416b87c69a8e02683b54ddd6edb90aea699648bf655e6cbc45b419b8e465d196e715772463dba35a6faf5decb2eb247480d38680484d54645b434570.js integrity="sha512-yQuBYUFrh8aajgJoO1Td1u25Cupplki/ZV5svEW0GbjkZdGW5xV3JGPbo1pvr13ssuskdIDThoBITVRkW0NFcA=="></script></body></html>
