I&rsquo;m Ercan Akyürek, a tech enthusiast in my early thirties who&rsquo;s super into all things innovative. I grew up in Germany, surrounded by a mix of German and Turkish cultures that have shaped my view of the world.</p><p>My love for computers started way back when I got my first VTech learning computer. I didn&rsquo;t really get coding at first, but I was totally hooked on the endless possibilities it offered. I taught myself programming in PHP and later ventured into the world of C++. By the time I was 16, I was already working professionally, developing a digital asset management system for a company and later working in finance. My skills have improved over the years, but my passion for tech has stayed strong.</p><p>I&rsquo;m all about web development, especially within the awesome React ecosystem. I&rsquo;m really good with TypeScript and I know my way around C++ and WebAssembly to make my real-time web apps, like simulations, super fast and efficient.</p><p>In my free time, I have a unique hobby—building roller coasters on my computer using NoLimits Roller Coaster. I play around with tracks, roll interpolations, and all that cool stuff. I&rsquo;ve even coded some libraries for a few games. Oh, and I&rsquo;ve taken up darts as a substitute for soccer because of some knee injuries. I also love playing the guitar, which I started after getting injured in a soccer match when I was 18. Playing guitar is the ultimate stress reliever for me, especially since I&rsquo;m a die-hard metal fan.</p><p>I&rsquo;m happily married and have the most adorable 15-month-old kid. I&rsquo;m already introducing them to the world of computers because it&rsquo;s never too early to start, right? My family means everything to me, and they&rsquo;ve always been there, supporting my interests and passions. Right now, I&rsquo;m working on an open-source roller coaster simulator that I hope will be a super useful resource for the community.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s connect and dive into the exciting world of technology together!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.c90b8161416b87c69a8e02683b54ddd6edb90aea699648bf655e6cbc45b419b8e465d196e715772463dba35a6faf5decb2eb247480d38680484d54645b434570.js integrity="sha512-yQuBYUFrh8aajgJoO1Td1u25Cupplki/ZV5svEW0GbjkZdGW5xV3JGPbo1pvr13ssuskdIDThoBITVRkW0NFcA=="></script></body></html>
