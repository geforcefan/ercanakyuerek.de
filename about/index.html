I grew up in Germany, shaped by both German and Turkish cultures, which gave me a unique perspective on life and technology.</p><p>My passion for computers started early with a VTech learning computer. Although I didn’t fully grasp coding at first, I was hooked by the possibilities. I taught myself PHP, later ventured into C++, and by 16, I was working professionally, developing a digital asset management system for a company. Over the years, I’ve refined my skills and stayed deeply passionate about tech.</p><p>These days, I focus on web development, especially with React and TypeScript. I also use C++ and WebAssembly to create high-performance applications, like simulations and real-time web apps.</p><p>In my free time, I enjoy designing roller coasters virtually with NoLimits Roller Coaster. I work on track layouts, roll interpolations, and other technical details, and I’ve even written libraries for games. After knee injuries forced me to give up soccer, I picked up the guitar at 18 and, more recently, started playing darts. The guitar has become my favorite way to relax, especially since I’m a big fan of metal music.</p><p>I’m married and have a wonderful 3-year-old. I’ve already started introducing them to computers because it’s never too early to spark curiosity! My family is my biggest source of support and inspiration. Currently, I’m working on an open-source roller coaster simulator that I hope will benefit the community and fellow enthusiasts.</p><p>Let’s connect and dive into the world of technology and innovation together!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.7ca7495aa22edd436bceff17b1818e90c8d5839ec76fc7b2eb66b1952ba886e725976e10d191029ca6fee36fcb7d0c1ae0293698c4cb954ef5ec52f5b5fa3c9d.js integrity="sha512-fKdJWqIu3UNrzv8XsYGOkMjVg57Hb8ey62axlSuohucll24Q0ZECnKb+42/LfQwa4Ck2mMTLlU717FL1tfo8nQ=="></script></body></html>
