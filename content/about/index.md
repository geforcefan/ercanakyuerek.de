{{< avatar >}}
Greetings! My name is Ercan Aky√ºrek,  and I am a technology enthusiast in my early thirties with a passion for innovation. Growing up in Germany, I was exposed to a unique blend of German and Turkish cultural influences that have shaped my worldview.

My fascination with computers started at a young age when I received my first VTech learning computer. Although I didn't initially understand how to write code, the possibilities it presented captivated me. Over time, I taught myself how to program in PHP and eventually moved on to learning C++. By the age of 16, I had already entered the professional field, working for a company that developed a digital asset management system and later for financial institutions. Despite my knowledge and skills improving over the years, my passion for technology has remained constant.

My area of expertise is web development, particularly within the React ecosystem. I have a high level of proficiency in TypeScript and am adept at using C++ and WebAssembly to enhance the performance of my real-time web applications, such as simulations.

In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my hobby of building roller coasters on my computer using NoLimits Roller Coaster. I experiment with splines, roll interpolations, roller coaster track generation, and have coded many libraries for a couple of games. Additionally, I have taken up playing darts as a substitution for soccer due to knee injuries. Playing the guitar is another passion of mine that I picked up after sustaining a knee injury from a soccer match when I was 18. As a hardcore metal fan, playing the guitar serves as an excellent stress reliever for me.

I am happily married and have a 15-month-old child whom I am already introducing to the world of computers. My family is incredibly important to me, and they have always been supportive of my interests and pursuits. Currently, I am working on an open-source roller coaster simulator that I hope will be a valuable resource for the community.
