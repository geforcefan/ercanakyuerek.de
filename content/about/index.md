{{< avatar >}}
Hi, I’m Ercan Akyürek, a tech enthusiast in my early thirties. I grew up in Germany, shaped by both German and Turkish cultures, which gave me a unique perspective on life and technology.

My passion for computers started early with a VTech learning computer. Although I didn’t fully grasp coding at first, I was hooked by the possibilities. I taught myself PHP, later ventured into C++, and by 16, I was working professionally, developing a digital asset management system for a company. Over the years, I’ve refined my skills and stayed deeply passionate about tech.

These days, I focus on web development, especially with React and TypeScript. I also use C++ and WebAssembly to create high-performance applications, like simulations and real-time web apps.

In my free time, I enjoy designing roller coasters virtually with NoLimits Roller Coaster. I work on track layouts, roll interpolations, and other technical details, and I’ve even written libraries for games. After knee injuries forced me to give up soccer, I picked up the guitar at 18 and, more recently, started playing darts. The guitar has become my favorite way to relax, especially since I’m a big fan of metal music.

I’m married and have a wonderful 3-year-old. I’ve already started introducing them to computers because it’s never too early to spark curiosity! My family is my biggest source of support and inspiration. Currently, I’m working on an open-source roller coaster simulator that I hope will benefit the community and fellow enthusiasts.

Let’s connect and dive into the world of technology and innovation together!
