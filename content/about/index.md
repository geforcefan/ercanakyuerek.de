{{< avatar >}}
I’m Ercan Akyürek, 34 years old, born and raised in Germany with roots in Turkey. From an early age, I was endlessly curious about how things worked, taking apart toys, motors, and gadgets just to see if I could rebuild them again. That curiosity for understanding and creating has been with me ever since.

My first real dive into computers came with a VTech learning computer that had a BASIC interpreter. I didn’t know much back then, but I was fascinated by the idea that I could make the machine do something just by typing commands. That simple curiosity quickly turned into a passion for coding.

During my teenage years, I taught myself PHP, experimented with C++, and played around with game engines. What started as a hobby soon became my profession. Today, my main focus is web and app development, especially with TypeScript and React. In my spare time, I love working with C++ and WebAssembly to build real-time applications and simulations.

One of my biggest interests outside of work is roller coaster design and simulation. I’ve written my own tools and libraries for coaster simulators, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge about splines, track layouts, and motion dynamics with the community.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing the guitar, mostly metal music or throwing darts. After multiple knee injuries forced me to give up soccer, darts became my new passion, and I’ve grown into a dedicated hobby player.

I’m married and a proud father of a 4-year-old son, who inspires me every day to keep learning, because he’s learning, too. Watching his curiosity reminds me why I fell in love with technology in the first place.
