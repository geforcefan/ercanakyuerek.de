title: Lightweight hybrid WLED app for mobile and web
---
The WLED Hybrid App is a lightweight application designed for both mobile and web platforms. Built atop Preact and React, along with other lightweight libraries, the app prioritizes minimal web bundle size, enabling seamless integration into WLED devices as the primary user interface. Leveraging the robustness of the React and Expo ecosystems, the app offers a native experience on iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a matured and polished user interface. While the previous UI has served its purpose admirably, the time has come for a matured app to meet the evolving needs of WLED users worldwide.

This project has recently begun, so stay tuned for updates! In my blog, I'll be documenting the progress of development and will eventually include screenshots showcasing our advancements. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue in the WLED-App repository.
